## Research Interests 
I am a condensed matter theorist interested in topological states of matter as well as their quantum dynamics. Particularly, I investigate the effect of the interplay between symmetry and topology of quantum systems on their static and dynamical properties. I am also interested in collaborating with experimentalists to understand STM and quantum transport measurements on different quantum materials.  

### Specifically, I am current working on:
- Topological phenomena in out-of-equilibrium quantum system
- Nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in general
- Interplay between symmetries and topology in quantum system
- 2D Morie materials
